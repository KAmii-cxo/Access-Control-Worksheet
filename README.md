# Access Control Worksheet

An Access Control Worksheet is a document that helps manage and track who has access to what in a system. It ensures only authorized people can access certain resources, and they only get the level of access they need.

## Key parts of the worksheet include:

1. **User Information**: Details about the person, like their name, role, and job.
2. **Resources/Systems**: List of what the person can access, like files or applications.
3. **Access Levels**: The permissions the person has, such as read or write access.
4. **Access Justification**: Why the person needs access.
5. **Effective Dates**: When the access starts and ends.
6. **Review and Approval**: Manager’s approval for access.
7. **Audit and Monitoring**: How access is tracked to ensure it’s used properly.
8. **Exceptions**: Any special cases where standard rules don't apply.

It helps maintain security by tracking and controlling who can access important resources.
